# Participium REST Tester

This MSc thesis project investigates automated black-box REST API test generation using
LLM-based agents and a metric-guided feedback loop. The systems under test are independent student
implementations of the Participium requirements, exposed through a common REST API contract.

## Current scope

The repository currently implements the workflow-preparation stage:

1. load the Participium description, FAQ, and user stories;
2. normalize a student project's OpenAPI or Swagger document;
3. run requirements, API-understanding, and test-strategy planning agents;
4. assemble a validated workflow plan and save reproducible run artifacts.

The XLSX remains authoritative for user-story IDs, roles, business values, and core text. LLM
analysis enriches those rows but cannot omit or renumber them. API operations are likewise
reconciled to Swagger, deterministic dependency edges are added for common state/resource flows,
and the strategy planner must pass semantic quality gates before a plan is accepted.

The current planning flow is:

```text
PDF/XLSX requirements -> deterministic loading -> Requirements Analyst -> source reconciliation
Swagger/OpenAPI       -> deterministic loading -> API Understanding   -> dependency enrichment
validated analyses + budget                         -> Strategy Planner -> quality finalization
                                                                  -> WorkflowPlan
```

Agents exchange validated Python objects through the Orchestrator. JSON files are persisted as
audit and reproducibility artifacts; they are not used as an ad-hoc message bus between agents.

It does **not** generate executable tests, call the SUT, reset SUT state, calculate metrics, or run
the iterative feedback loop yet.

The default future Python test format is **pytest + requests**. Generated tests will use explicit
timeouts, configuration-driven base URLs, isolated fixtures, and cleanup teardown. Newman/Postman
remains available as a second runner backend.

## Inputs

Place local inputs at the paths referenced by your YAML configuration. The example expects:

- `data/requirements/participium-description.pdf`
- `data/requirements/participium-userstories.xlsx`
- `data/requirements/participium-faq.pdf`
- `projects/participium-team09/swagger.yaml`
- a running SUT base URL, defaulting to `http://localhost:8080`

Requirement documents and student projects are local inputs and are ignored by Git. Relative paths
are resolved from the repository working directory. For additional student systems, create one
configuration per project and change `project_name`, `openapi_path`, and `sut_base_url`, for example:

```text
configs/participium-team09.yaml
configs/participium-team10.yaml
```

## Setup

Python 3.12 or newer is required.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
cp .env.example .env
```

Configure a model identifier in `.env`. Add a real key only for live Groq runs:

```dotenv
GROQ_MODEL=your-configured-groq-model
GROQ_API_KEY=your-secret-key
```

One model currently used for development runs is:

```dotenv
GROQ_MODEL=meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct
```

Environment variables exported by the shell take precedence over `.env`. Never commit `.env`.

## Prepare a workflow plan

Dry-run mode replaces all LLM calls with deterministic JSON and does not require an API key. It
still loads and validates the configured PDF, XLSX, and OpenAPI files.

```bash
python -m thesis_rest_tester.cli plan \
  --config configs/participium.example.yaml \
  --dry-run
```

For a real Groq run:

```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="..."
export GROQ_MODEL="..."
python -m thesis_rest_tester.cli plan --config configs/participium.example.yaml
```

The model is always configuration-driven; no Groq model identifier is hardcoded in Python.
The Groq SDK retries transient and rate-limit failures. On low-rate-limit tiers, a real planning
run may pause between calls while the token-per-minute window resets.

## Planning safeguards

The pipeline treats deterministic documentation as authoritative and LLM output as an enrichment:

- all XLSX requirement IDs, roles, business values, and core texts are preserved;
- omitted or renumbered LLM requirements cannot remove or corrupt XLSX traceability;
- description/FAQ-only requirements may be added with `DESC-*` or `FAQ-*` IDs;
- every normalized Swagger method/path remains present after API analysis;
- deterministic registration, resource, assignment, messaging, and state dependencies are merged
  with model-inferred dependency edges;
- authenticated operations receive authentication setup;
- path-parameter operations receive resource setup when needed;
- mutating operations receive cleanup guidance;
- stateful tests are added from dependency edges when the model omits them;
- over-budget strategies are reduced while preserving required test types and maximizing distinct
  requirement/operation coverage;
- accepted strategies must include happy-path, edge-case, negative, and—when applicable—stateful
  tests, mixed priorities, valid traceability, and at least 80% budget utilization when possible.

These safeguards improve structure and traceability without silently treating an LLM response as
ground truth. Semantic quality still requires measurement and, later, execution feedback.

## Run artifacts

Each plan is stored under `data/runs/<run_id>/`:

- `config.resolved.yaml`
- `requirements_compact.txt`
- `openapi_operations.json`
- `requirements_analysis.raw.txt` and `requirements_analysis.json`
- `api_analysis.raw.txt` and `api_analysis.json`
- `test_strategy.raw.txt` and `test_strategy.json`
- `workflow_plan.json`
- `summary.md`

If the first strategy draft fails diversity, traceability, stateful-flow, setup, or cleanup checks,
`test_strategy.attempt1.raw.txt` is also retained and the planner receives one corrective call when
the configured LLM-call budget permits it.

Boundary-only Markdown JSON fences are normalized during parsing. If any agent returns malformed
JSON or a schema-invalid value, one automatic repair call is made and the original response is
retained as `<agent>.validation_attempt1.raw.txt`. Arbitrary prose and multiple JSON values remain
invalid so parsing cannot silently accept ambiguous output.

Raw model output is written before JSON parsing, so malformed responses remain available for
debugging. Resolved configuration artifacts never contain the Groq API key.

`workflow_plan.json` is the canonical planning output for future generation agents. It combines the
validated requirements analysis, API analysis, strategy items, assumptions, risks, and run metadata.

## Quality checks

```bash
pytest
ruff check .
```

The test suite covers configuration loading, environment expansion, input parsing, dry-run
orchestration, CLI behavior, fence normalization, schema repair, source-ID preservation, dependency
inference, strategy correction, authentication setup, cleanup, and budget/coverage gates.

## Current limitations

- generation prompts exist, but generation agents are not implemented;
- no pytest/requests or Newman suite is generated or executed yet;
- the configured SUT base URL and reset command are not used during planning;
- metrics are modeled but their collectors still raise `NotImplementedError`;
- `max_iterations` and the feedback/stop loop are not active yet;
- `max_llm_calls` permits planner correction but is not yet tracked globally;
- interrupted runs cannot currently resume from their validated intermediate artifacts;
- role vocabulary and requirement/API contradictions still need explicit normalization/reporting.

## Planned next steps

The next useful increment is to define an executable test-case model and implement the Happy-Path,
Edge-Case, Adversarial, and Test Writer agents. The Test Writer will emit pytest modules using
`requests`; later increments can implement their static runner, the Newman runner, SUT reset hooks,
metric collection, and the feedback loop that routes evaluation back through the Orchestrator.
The modular provider and runner interfaces are already in place for those additions and for future
collaborative or competitive agent modes.
